  <h1>Web Security Recommendations</h1>
  <p><b>Make your updates:</b> This is one of the best security practices there are. Browser updates takes only one or two seconds, and could be fixing important vulnerabilities.</p>
  <p><b>Password management:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Use a password manager</li>
      <li>Use password best practices (strong passwords, no repetition, etc.)</li>
      <li>Do not save your passwords (or credit card information) on your web browser. 
        Use your password manager instead.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
    
  <p><b>Two-factor authentication (2FA):</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Always enable 2FA, when possible.</li>
      <li>For regular users, I'd recommend using authenticator apps. Avoid SMS options. 
        For more advanced users, have a look at <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKeys</a>. </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
    
  <p><b>Browser the web using HTTPS:</b> HTTPS encrypts requests and responses made between your device and the webistes you visit. Make sure your browser is set up to enable HTTPS-Only (most browsers have this functionality). 
    Alternatively, you can use extensions such as <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere"> HTTPS Everywhere</a>.</p>
  </p>

  
  <p>These recommendations are not exhaustive, please treat them as suggestions.</p>
  <p>Many thanks to <a href="https://sunknudsen.com/">Sun Knudsen</a>. His great Youtube channel piqued my interest concerning web privacy and security, and a lot of my set up is based on his.</p>
