  <h1>Understanding Web Tracking and Its Implications for Everyday Users</h1>
    <h4>A short introduction to web tracking</h4>
      <p>
      Web tracking refers to the practice of monitoring and recording user activities
      and interactions on the internet, typically for the purpose of gathering data and analytics.
      This involves the collection of information about users' online behavior, such as the websites they visit,
      the pages they view, the links they click, the time spent on various webpages, and more. <br><br>

      Web tracking is an omnipresent aspect of our online experience. It is is present on about 90% of websites [1].
      Among these, cookies are the most widespread, capable of reconstructing the majority of users' browsing histories [2]. 
      This data is often traded among third parties, serving as a valuable resource for understanding user behavior.<br> 
      <!-- It is also relevant to note that mutliple mechanisms (cookie sync, zombie cookies, etc.) exist that allow trackers to recognize a user despite clearing one's history, cookies, browser cache, etc.
      In other words, it can be very hard for users to detach themselves from their online tracking profile. -->

      <h4>Why should you care?</h4>
      <!-- <p>Before you ask: Yes, trackers are one of the main reasons you get personalised ads on the internet. While this personalisation can be viewed as a positive thing by some, consider the factors below:</p> -->
      <div>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Lack of regulation: </b>Online privacy lacks robust regulation (especially outside of the EU) and enforcement. Some regulation
                                            now requires user consent before tracking can be performed (hence a rise in the presence of cookie banners),
                                            but most websites have been found not to respect the regulation or the user's decision [3]. Unfortunately, for now,
                                            users can only rely on the steps <i>they take</i> to protect their data. </li>
            
            <li><b>Security: </b>78% of tracking data has been found to be exchanged in an unsafe way [4],
                                 potentially leaking personal information such as your full name, email address, phone number, date of birth, and login credentials [5]. In addition, once your tracking
                                 data is stored in third-party databases, then your information is exposed to a potential data breach.
                                 Once your tracking data is out there, it is not coming back and you cannot control what it will be used for.</li>
            
            <li><b>Avoiding manipulation: </b>The data collected by cookies and trackers can be used to manipulate your online experience.
                                                For example, most web users are shown biased news and content that reinforces 
                                                your existing beliefs (echo chambers). This contributes to polarization, a serious threat to democracy. 
                                                One simply needs to recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> to see
                                                how user data can be used without one's consent or knowledge in order to influence one's behavior. 
                                                </li>
            <li><b>Protection from surveillance: </b>Online privacy safeguards individuals from extensive surveillance, which plays a crucial role in upholding 
                                                          the principles of freedom of speech and freedom of opinion in democratic societies.
                                                          Throughout history, individuals have used aliases, pseudonyms, or anonymity to protect their identities when
                                                          expressing dissenting opinions or advocating for social and political change. In the digital age, preserving online
                                                          privacy serves as the modern equivalent of these historical safeguards. It allows people to freely express dissent, 
                                                          engage in open discourse, and challenge the status quo without fear of government or corporate monitoring.</li>
            
            <li><b>Future Impact: </b>I kept what is probably the most important for last: data collected today may have unforseen long-term consequences. 
                                      User data generated online must be considered permanent data. Even if you delete your accounts, and try to delete your data, chances
                                      are that copies of this data already exist in different databases, backups, and archives. With this in mind, one must
                                      think about the fact that information shared innocuously today might be reinterpreted or repurposed in the future,
                                      potentially causing unintended consequences. </li>
