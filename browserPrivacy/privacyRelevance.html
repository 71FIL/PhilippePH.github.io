  <h1>Understanding Web Tracking and Its Implications for Everyday Users</h1>
    <h4>A short introduction to web tracking</h4>
      Web tracking is an omnipresent aspect of our online experience. It is is present on about 90% of websites [1].
      Tracking is done through various methods, including cookies, local storage, scripts, invisible pixels, iframes, fingerprinting, etc.
      Among these, cookies are the most widespread, capable of reconstructing the majority of users' browsing histories [3]. 
      This data is often traded among third parties, serving as a valuable resource for understanding user behavior.

      <h4>Why should you care?</h4>
      <p>Before you ask, yes, trackers are one of the main reasons you get personalised ads on the internet. While this personalisation can be viewed as a positive thing by some, consider the factors below:</p>
      <div>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Lack of regulation: </b>Online privacy lacks robust regulation (especially outside of the EU),
                                           necessitating user vigilance for self-protection. </li>
            
            <li><b>Security: </b>Much tracking data is exchanged without proper encryption[3 quoting someone else],
                                 potentially leaking personal information such as XYZ (source). In addition, once your tracking
                                 data is stored in third-party databases, then your information is exposed to a potential data breach.
                                 Once your tracking data is out there, it is not coming back and you cannot control what it will be used for.</li>
            
            <li><b>Avoiding manipulation: </b>The data collected by cookies and trackers can be used to manipulate your online experience 
                                                (yes, yes personalised ads but we're talking about more serious stuff here). 
                                                For example, you are probably constantly being shown biased news and content that reinforces 
                                                your existing beliefs. This contributes to polarization, a threat to democracy. A more concrete 
                                                example of how your data can be used to influence you, in 2016 Cambridge Analytica built personality
                                                profiles of US Facebook users in order to personalise political campaign messages to specific groups of
                                                voters.</li>
            
            <li><b>Future Impact: </b>I kept what is probably the most important for last: data collected today may have unforseen long-term consequences. Online privacy is, and will become even more, essential to safeguard freedom of speech and freedom of opinion.</li>
