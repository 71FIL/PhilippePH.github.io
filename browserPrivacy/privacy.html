  <h1>My browser privacy setup recommendation</h1>
    <p><i>Not sure why you should care yet? Check this page out: <a href="./privacyRelevance.html">The Relevance of Web Privacy for Everyday Users</a></i></p>
      
    <ul>
      <li>Use a more privacy-focused browser. I currently use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>.</li>
      <li>Install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery-%E2%80%93-privacy-ad-blo/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij">Ghostery</a> web extension. It will help block a lot of trackers, and reduce the number of annoying cookie banner.</li>
      <li>Install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">containers</a> extension, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-use-firefox-containers">set it up</a> according to your internet usage. This isolates cookies, scripts, etc. per container, meaning you "containarize" your browsing ** ADD HERE ***. This is also great for security reasons, as malicious scripts are limited to the container they are contained in. </li>
      <li>Disable sponsored shortcuts and sponsored stories (I disable them altogether). I also disabled Snippets. (<a href="about:preferences#home">here</a>) </li>
      <li>Change the default search engine to DuckDuckGo (<a href="about:preferences#search">here</a>)</li>
      <li>Use "custom" tracking protection. Tick every box, and select "all cross-site cookies" and "in all windows". (<a href="about:preferences#privacy">here</a>) Personally, I have found that very few websites actually break. In those rare cases, I simple click the Firefox lock icon in the search bar, disable enhanced protection for that one website, reload and then the issue is fixed. </li>
      <li>I do NOT delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed, because I have found this to be too much of a hurdle (it logs you out of every website, everytime Firefox closes). I do however enable the functionality "Clear history when Firefox closes" as this does not impact my browsing experience much.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>These recommendations are not exhaustive, treat them as suggestions. Many thanks to <a href="https://sunknudsen.com/">Sun Knudsen</a>. His great Youtube channel piqued my interest concerning web privacy and security, and a lot of my set up is based on his.</p>

     <h3>Do you absolutely want to keep using Google Chrome?</h3>
      <p>If you absolutely want to keep using Google Chrome (which I don't recommend), then here's how you can make some improvements to your setup.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider using a different web browser</li>
        <li>Install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery-%E2%80%93-privacy-ad-blo/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij">Ghostery</a> web extension. It will help block a lot of trackers, and reduce the number of annoying cookie banner.</li>
        <li>Disable everything in the <a href="chrome://settings/adPrivacy">ad menu</a></li>
        <li>Remove <a href="chrome://settings/privacy/guide?step=msbb">"Make searches and browsing better"</a></li>
        <li>Refuse when websites ask to access your location, unless you judge it to be absolutely necessary</li>
        <li>Use the DuckDuckGo (or other privacy-focused search engine). For day-to-day browsing, DuckDuckGo should be satisfactory. When doing advanced research, it might be useful to use Google as its search results are still better.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These recommendations are not exhaustive, and I'd argue that you cannot really be private when using Google Chrome</p>
