  <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a graduate student at Imperial College London (UK), a world-leading university in science and engineering, where I am pursuing a master's degree in computer science (MSc Computing). Through this program, I am developing a strong foundation in core and specialized topics in computing while gaining hands-on practical skills. I have worked with programming languages such as C++, Python, and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Prior to my current studies, I obtained a Bachelor of Commerce (Finance) degree from McGill University's Desautels Faculty of Management (Canada), where I developed a solid foundation in business, finance, and sustainability. This multidisciplinary background equips me with a unique perspective that blends technical expertise with a deep understanding of organizational needs and challenges.</p>
    <p>Driven by my passion for leveraging technology to make a positive impact, I am actively seeking opportunities in software development. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy tackling complex challenges.</p>
