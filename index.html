  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I have recently graduated from Imperial College London (UK), a world-leading university in science and engineering, where I pursued a master's degree in computer science (MSc Computing). Through this program, I am developped a strong foundation in core and specialized computing topics while gaining hands-on practical skills. I have worked with programming languages such as C++, Python, and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Prior to my masters, I obtained a Bachelor of Commerce (Finance) degree from McGill University's Desautels Faculty of Management (Canada), where I developed a solid foundation in business, finance, and sustainability. This multidisciplinary background equips me with a unique perspective that blends technical expertise with a deep understanding of organizational needs and challenges.</p>

  <h3>Current Projects and Interests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Web privacy and security: </b>I have been interested in web privacy and security for over a year. Two resources I am very fond of are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SunKnudsen">Sun Knudsen's YouTube channel</a>, and <a href="https://inteltechniques.com/podcast.html">Michael Bazzell's Privacy, Security and OSINT podcast</a>. Recently, I have also been reading up on cybersecurity and OSINT.</li>
    <li><b>ConnectED: </b>I am currently advising McGill students who are running the <a href="https://connectedmcgill.wixsite.com/connected">ConnectED initiative</a>, an initiative I created during my last year at McGill with some amazing teammates and friends. ConnectED's goal is to diversify learning opportunities by connecting university students with elementary-secondary classrooms.</li>
    <li><b>Cocktail App: </b>I find making cocktails, and understanding the different properties of different ingredients very fun. When I was starting out, I created a tool that helped me categorize cocktails and list recipes I could make based on the ingredients I had at home. I am currently adapting this tools to make it into an app, as well as adding a multitude of features I've had in the back of my head for about two years now! For all my friends who've been waiting for this app for two years, I appreciate your patience: It is coming... eventually!</li>
    <li><b>Varia: </b>I enjoy exploring the world of coffee (experimenting with different brew styles, different coffee beans, tasting coffee, reading about coffee, the list goes on and on!). I have been improving the quantity (and quality) of what I read (and watch), and I am always excited to leave a review on my goodreads (and letterboxd) profiles. Finally, with the half-marathon and olympic triathlon milestones achieved, I'm now hoping to run a complete marathon in the coming year or so.</li>
